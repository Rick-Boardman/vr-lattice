# Lattice contributor and agent instructions

Read [README.md](README.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and
[docs/quick-start.md](docs/quick-start.md) before changing code. Developers and AI
coding agents may use, modify, redistribute, and contribute under Apache-2.0.
Third-party material keeps its own licenses; see [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md).

Lattice owns graph normalization, layout, meshes, picking, Mermaid support,
and graph-scene composition. Reuse Halo for rendering, HUD, navigation, and XR.
Workflow execution, business rules, persistence, and integrations belong in apps.

Keep public module paths stable. Do not introduce credentials, private service
URLs, machine-specific setup, or dependencies on neighboring checkouts. Follow
the existing ES module style. Retain useful API comments and explain unusual
render-order, coordinate-system, and device constraints. Do not add a second
Three.js instance to an application. Dispose listeners and graphics resources.

Consumers pin a tag (`github:Rick-Boardman/vr-lattice#vX.Y.Z` in their package.json)
and import `@rb/lattice/...` from `node_modules`, never from a sibling checkout. A change
a consumer wants lands here first: a branch, `npm run build` green, a merged pull
request, then a tag the consumer moves its pin to. Never edit this checkout in passing
from a consumer task.

Run `npm run build`, `npm run test:browser`, and `npm run audit:release`.
Report actual results and device limitations; do not claim physical Quest testing
from a simulated XR session. Document public API or installation changes.
